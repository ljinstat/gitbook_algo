# 426. Convert Binary Search Tree to Sorted Doubly Linked List \(medium locked\)

## Question:

> Convert a BST to a sorted circular doubly-linked list in-place. Think of the left and right pointers as synonymous to the previous and next pointers in a doubly-linked list.

## Thought:

* left tree and right tree is linked by root

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    """
    @param root: root of a tree
    @return: head node of a doubly linked list
    """
    # 1. traverse -------------------------
    def inorder(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 
        left = node.left
        for n in self.inorder(left): # first output the leftmost one
            yield n
        yield node
        right = node.right
        for n in self.inorder(right):
            yield n
    
    def treeToDoublyList(self, root):
        # Write your code here.
        # traverse
        if not root:
            return root
        prev = None
        first = None
        last = None
        for n in self.inorder(root):
            if not first:
                first = n
            last = n
            if prev:
                prev.right = n
                n.left = prev
            prev = n
        first.left = last
        last.right = first
        return first
