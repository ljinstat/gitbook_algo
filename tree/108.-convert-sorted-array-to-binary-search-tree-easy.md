# 108. Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree \(easy\)

## Question:

Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than 1.

```text
Given the sorted array: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
```

## Thought:

* DFS recursion + binary 

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def sortedArrayToBST(self, nums: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
        return self.dfs(nums, 0, len(nums)-1)
    
    def dfs(self, nums, left, right):
        if left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            root = TreeNode(nums[mid])
            root.left = self.dfs(nums, left, mid-1)
            root.right = self.dfs(nums, mid+1, right)
            return root
```
