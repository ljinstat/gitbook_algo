# 113. Path Sum II \(medium\)

## Question:

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```text
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
```

Return:

```text
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```

## Thought:

* DFS + stack

## Solution:

```text
def pathSum2(self, root, sum):
        # dfs + stack
        if not root:
            return []
        stack = [(root, sum-root.val, [root.val])]
        result = []
        while stack:
            curr, residu, ls = stack.pop()
            if not curr.left and not curr.right and residu == 0:
                result.append(ls)
            if curr.right:
                self.pathSum2(curr.right, residu-curr.right.val, ls+[curr.right.val])
            if curr.left:
                self.pathSum2(curr.left, residu-curr.left.val, ls+[curr.left.val])
        return result
```
