# 110. Balanced Binary Tree \(easy\)

## Question:

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:

> a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of _every_ node never differ by more than 1.

**Example 1:**

Given the following tree `[3,9,20,null,null,15,7]`:

```text
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
```

Return true.

## Thought:

* traverse recursion
* using a helper, conditions: left is balanced? right is balanced? the depth difference between left and right is more than one? return depth of this tree
* result type: return -1 or depth

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def isBalanced(self, root):
        """
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: bool
        """
        non_balance = -1
        return self.getHeight(root) != non_balance
    
    def getHeight(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0
        left = self.getHeight(root.left)
        right = self.getHeight(root.right)
        if left == non_balance or right == non_balance or abs(left - right) > 1:
            return -1
        return max(left, right) + 1
```
