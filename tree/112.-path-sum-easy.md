# 112. Path Sum \(easy\)

## Question:

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```text
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.

## Thought:

* recursion

## Solution:

```text
def pathSum(self, root, sum):
        # recursion
        if not root:
            return False
        if not root.left and not root.right and sum - root.val == 0:
            return True
        sum -= root.val
        return self.pathSum(root.left, sum) or self.pathSum(root.right, sum)
```
