# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree \(easy\)

## Question:

Given a binary search tree \(BST\), find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”

Given binary search tree:  root = \[6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5\]

## Thought:

The lowest common ancestor for a binary search tree must be larger than the left child and smaller than the right child. If it is larger or smaller than both nodes, it means that it is not the lowest one.

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        # recursion top down
        if p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)
        elif p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)
        else:
            return root
        # iteration:
        node = root
        while node:
            if p.val > node.val and q.val > node.val:
                node = node.right
            elif p.val < node.val and q.val < node.val:
                node = node.left
            else:
                return node
```
