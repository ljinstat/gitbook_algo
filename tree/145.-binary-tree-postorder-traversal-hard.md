# 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal \(hard\)

## Question:

Given a binary tree, return the _postorder_ traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [1,null,2,3]
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3

Output: [3,2,1]
```

**Follow up:** Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

## Thought:

* Post-order traversal is to traverse the left subtree first. Then traverse the right subtree. Finally, visit the root.
* [https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/992/](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/data-structure-tree/134/traverse-a-tree/992/)
* It is worth noting that when you delete nodes in a tree, deletion process will be in post-order. That is to say, when you delete a node, you will delete its left child and its right child before you delete the node itself.

  Also, post-order is widely use in mathematical expression. It is easier to write a program to parse a post-order expression. 

* iteration: reversed preorder traversal

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def postorderTraversal(self, root):
        # iteration
        if not root:
            return []
        result, stack = [], []
        stack.append(root)
        while stack:
            curr = stack.pop()
            if curr:
                result.append(curr.val) 
                if curr.left:
                    stack.append(curr.left) # left then right then root
                if curr.right:
                    stack.append(curr.right)
        return result[::-1]
        # ---------------------------------
        # recursion
        if not root:
            return []
        result = []
        self.postorder(root, result)
        return result
        
        def postorder(self, root, result):
            if root:
                self.postorder(root.left, result)
                self.postorder(root.right, result)
                result.append(root.val)
```
