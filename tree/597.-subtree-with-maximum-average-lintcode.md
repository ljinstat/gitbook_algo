# 597. Subtree with Maximum Average \(lintcode\)

## Question:

**Description**  
Given a binary tree, find the subtree with maximum average. Return the root of the subtree.  
  
**Notice**  
LintCode will print the subtree which root is your return node.  
It's guaranteed that there is only one subtree with maximum average.

## Thought:

* average is sum of a substree divided by the number of nodes
* global variable in class
* return value of helper needs to fulfill inside recursion

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    ave = 0 # global tree average
    node = None # the result
    def subtreeMaxave(self, root):
        if not root:
            return root
        self.helper(root)
        return self.node
    def helper(self, root):
        if not root:
            return 0, 0
        sumLeft, countLeft = self.helper(root.left)
        sumRight, countRight = self.helper(root.right)
        sumTree = sumLeft + sumRight + root.val
        countTree = countLeft + countRight + 1
        aveTree = sumTree * 1.0 / countTree # accuracy transformed to float
        if aveTree > self.ave or not self.node: # also look at self.node
            self.ave = aveTree
            self.node = root
        return sumTree, countTree
```
