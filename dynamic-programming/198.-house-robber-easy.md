# 198. House Robber \(easy\)

## Question:

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.

## Thought:

* DP
* max\(curr + dp\[i-2\], dp\[i-1\]\)

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def rob(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums: return 0
        if len(nums) == 1: return nums[0]
        all = [0]*len(nums)
        all[0] = nums[0]
        all[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            all[i] = max(nums[i]+all[i-2], all[i-1])
        return all[-1]
```
