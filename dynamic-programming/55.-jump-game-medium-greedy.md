# 55. Jump Game \(medium\) \(greedy\)

## Question:

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Determine if you are able to reach the last index.

## Thought:

* gready??
* if at i the max\_reach is smaller than i, it means that we cannot move anymore

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if not nums:
            return
        can_reach = nums[0]
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            if i > can_reach:  # if at i, we cannot reach i index, it means we cannot jump any more
                return False
            can_reach = max(can_reach, i+num)
        return True
```
