# 72. Edit Distance \(hard\)

Given two words _word1_ and _word2_, find the minimum number of operations required to convert _word1_ to _word2_.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

```text
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

## Thought:

* Dynamic Programming \(distance table\)
* three conditions
* sub-problems -&gt; sub-string A -&gt; B key table\(replace, insert, delete, current index\)

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, sa: str, sb: str) -> int:
        # None = ''
        m = len(sa)
        n = len(sb)
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]
        for j in range(n+1):
            dp[0][j] = j
        for i in range(m+1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            for j in range(1, n+1):
                if sa[i-1] == sb[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i][j-1]) + 1
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
