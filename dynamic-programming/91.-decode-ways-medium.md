# 91. Decode Ways \(medium\)

## Question:

A message containing letters from `A-Z` is being encoded to numbers using the following mapping:

```text
'A' -> 1
'B' -> 2
...
'Z' -> 26
```

Given a **non-empty** string containing only digits, determine the total number of ways to decode it.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: It could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

## Thought:

* Dynamic programming

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def numDecodings(self, s: str) -> int:
        if not s or len(s) == 0:
            return 0
        dp = [0] * (len(s) + 1)
        # the way of decoding for empty string
        dp[0] = 1
        # the way of decoding for the first number
        dp[1] = 1 if s[0] != '0' else 0
        for i in range(2, len(s)+1):
            first = int(s[i-1:i])
            second = int(s[i-2:i])
            if first >= 1 and first <= 9:
                dp[i] += dp[i-1]
            if second >= 10 and second <= 26:
                dp[i] += dp[i-2]
        return dp[len(s)]
```
