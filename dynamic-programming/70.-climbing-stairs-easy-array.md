# 70. Climbing Stairs \(easy\) \(array\)

## Question:

You are climbing a stair case. It takes _n_ steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given _n_ will be a positive integer.

## Thought:

* initialize the array with 1 and 2 at the begining 
* the edging-case is n == 1

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if not n:
            return
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        paths = [0] * n
        paths[0] = 1
        paths[1] = 2
        for i in range(2, n):
            paths[i] = paths[i-1] + paths[i-2]
        return paths[-1]
```
