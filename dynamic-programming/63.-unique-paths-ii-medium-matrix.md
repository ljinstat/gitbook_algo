# 63. Unique Paths II \(medium\) \(matrix\)

## Question:

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
Output: 2
Explanation:
There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Thought:

* the differences between I and II are:
* when fill the first row and column with values, the initial value is 0 instead of 1
* in I, the first row and the first column only have one path, so it is ok to neglect them.
* initiate rows and cols 
* \(1 - obstacleGrid\[i\]\[j\]\) to verify whether it is 0 at this point
* we can also write in-place

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # O(n)
        if not obstacleGrid:
            return 
        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        paths = [0] * n
        paths[0] = 1 - obstacleGrid[0][0]
        for j in range(1, n):
            paths[j] = paths[j-1] * (1 - obstacleGrid[0][j])
        for i in range(1, m):
            paths[0] *= (1 - obstacleGrid[i][0])
            for j in range(1, n):
                paths[j] = (paths[j-1] + paths[j]) * (1 - obstacleGrid[i][j])
        return paths[-1]
```
