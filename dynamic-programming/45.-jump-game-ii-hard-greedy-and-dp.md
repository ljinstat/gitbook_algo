# 45. Jump Game II \(hard\) \(greedy and DP\) \(unclear\)

## Question:

Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

## Thought:

* greedy
* at each jump, we jump with farthest step. Only when we reach the maximal reachable jump, we jump another time.
* DP ????

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # greedy
        if not nums:
            return
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return 0
        max_reach = nums[0]
        cur_reach = nums[0]
        step = 1
        i = 0
        while i <= min(max_reach, len(nums)):
            cur_reach  = max(cur_reach, i+nums[i])
            if i == len(nums) - 1:
                return step
            if i == max_reach:
                max_reach = cur_reach
                step += 1
            i += 1
        return -1
        # DP
        p = [0]
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
            while(i + nums[i] >= len(p) and len(p) < len(nums)):
                p.append(p[i] + 1)
        return p[-1]
```
