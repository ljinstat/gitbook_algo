# 1143. Longest Common Subsequence \(medium\)

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A _subsequence_ of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters\(can be none\) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. \(eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not\). A _common subsequence_ of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.  


## Thought:

* 2D DP table

## Solution:

```text
def longest_subseq(self, a, b):
		if not a or not b:
			return 0
		m = len(a)
		n = len(b)
		dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
		for i in range(m):
			for j in range(n):
				if a[i] == b[j]:
					dp[i+1][j+1] = dp[i][j] + 1
				else:
					dp[i+1][j+1] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j+1])
		return dp[-1][-1]
```
