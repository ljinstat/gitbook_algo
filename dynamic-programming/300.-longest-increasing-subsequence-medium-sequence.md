# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence \(medium\) \(sequence\)

## Question:

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

**Example:**

```text
Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
```

**Note:** 

* There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
* Your algorithm should run in O\(n2\) complexity.

**Follow up:** Could you improve it to O\(n log n\) time complexity?

## Thought:

* DP有方向性，f\[i\] 是第i个位置的LIS O\(n^2\)
* f\[i\] = max\(f\[i\], f\[j\] + 1\)
* binary search: O\(nlogn\) [https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/discuss/74824/JavaPython-Binary-search-O\(nlogn\)-time-with-explanation](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/discuss/74824/JavaPython-Binary-search-O%28nlogn%29-time-with-explanation)

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # DP 
        if not nums:
            return 0
        # init all 1
        subseq = [1] * len(nums)
        # for this element, find the maximal number of elements smaller than it in previous subseq
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    subseq[i] = max(subseq[i], subseq[j] + 1)
        return max(subseq)
```
