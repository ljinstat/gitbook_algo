# 62. Unique Paths \(medium\) \(matrix\)

## Question:

A robot is located at the top-left corner of a _m_ x _n_ grid \(marked 'Start' in the diagram below\).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid \(marked 'Finish' in the diagram below\).

How many possible unique paths are there?

**Note:** _m_ and _n_ will be at most 100.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down
2. Right -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Right
```

## Thought:

* the edges always have 1 path
* the sum begin from the \[1\]\[1\]

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # top down
        # the number of paths is different from the sum
        if not m or not n:
            return 
        paths = [1] * n
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                paths[j] += paths[j-1]
        return paths[-1]
        
```
