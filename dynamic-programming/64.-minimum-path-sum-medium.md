# 64. Minimum Path Sum \(medium\) \(matrix\)

## Question:

Given a _m_ x _n_ grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right which _minimizes_ the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
[
  [1,3,1],
  [1,5,1],
  [4,2,1]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1→3→1→1→1 minimizes the sum.
```

## Thought:

* top down
* going through all possible block, each block's previous block comes from two possibilities, top or left. 
* first of all, fill all edges with possible values, here the first row and the first column are filled with possible values.
* the final result is the right most value

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def minPathSum(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        if not grid:
            return 
        n = len(grid)
        m = len(grid[0])
        path = [0 for _ in range(m)]
        path[0] = grid[0][0]
        for j in range(1, m):
            path[j] = path[j-1] + grid[0][j]
        for i in range(1, n):
            path[0] += grid[i][0]
            for j in range(1, m):
                path[j] = min(path[j], path[j-1]) + grid[i][j]
        return path[-1]
```
