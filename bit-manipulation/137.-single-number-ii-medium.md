# 137. Single Number II \(medium\)

## Question:

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _three_ times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,2,3,2]
Output: 3
```

## Thought:

* feel bad about this exercise

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return None
        a, b = 0, 0
        for num in nums: # soooo confusing
            a = (a ^ num) & ~b
            b = (b ^ num) & ~a
        return a
```
