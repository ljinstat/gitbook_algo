# 260. Single Number III \(medium\)

## Question:

Given an array of numbers `nums`, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.

**Example:**

```text
Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5]
Output: [3,5]
```

**Note**:

1. The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, `[5, 3]` is also correct.
2. Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

## Thought:

The property is, the difference between a binary number n and n-1 is all the bits on the right of the rightmost 1 are flipped including the rightmost 1. Using this amazing property, we can get our solution as **x ^ \(x & \(x - 1\)\) \(get the rightmost 1 of x\)**

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        if not nums or len(nums) < 2:
            return None
        xor = 0
        for num in nums:
            xor ^= num
        xor = xor & (xor - 1) ^ xor # xor & -xor
        a, b = 0, 0
        for num in nums:
            if xor & num:
                a ^= num
            else:
                b ^= num
        return [a, b]
```
