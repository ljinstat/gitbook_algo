# 191. Number of 1 Bits \(easy\)

## Question:

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has \(also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)\).

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

## Thought:

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def hammingWeight(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        # loop and flip move to the left
        num_1 = 0
        mask = 1
        for i in range(32):
            if n & mask != 0:
                num_1 += 1
            mask <<= 1
        return num_1
        # bit manipulation
        s = 0
        while n != 0:
            n &= (n - 1)
            s += 1
        return s
        
```
