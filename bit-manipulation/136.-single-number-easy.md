# 136. Single Number \(easy\)

## Question:

Given a **non-empty** array of integers, every element appears _twice_ except for one. Find that single one.

**Note:**

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

```

## Thought:

* math
* hash table
* list operation
* bit manipulation O\(n\), O\(1\)

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # bit manipulation
        if not nums:
            return
        a = 0 # 0 ^ x = x, x ^ x = 0
        for num in nums:
            a ^= num
        return a
```
