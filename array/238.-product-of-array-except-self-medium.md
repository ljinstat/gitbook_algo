# 238. Product of Array Except Self \(medium\)

## Question:

Given an array `nums` of _n_ integers where _n_ &gt; 1,  return an array `output` such that `output[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

**Example:**

```text
Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Note:** Please solve it **without division** and in O\(_n_\).

**Follow up:**  
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? \(The output array **does not** count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.\)

## Thought:

* compute the product by multiplying the product of all elements to the left and to the right

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # left and right product lists
        length = len(nums)
        left, right, result = [0]*length, [0]*length, [0]*length
        left[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            left[i] = left[i-1] * nums[i-1]
        right[length-1] = 1
        for i in range(length-2, -1, -1):
            right[i] = right[i+1] * nums[i+1]
        for i in range(length):
            result[i] = left[i] * right[i]
        return result
        # O(1) space approach
        length = len(nums)
        right, result = 1, [0]*length
        result[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, length):
            result[i] = result[i-1] * nums[i-1]
        for i in range(length-1, -1, -1): # a little bit tricky
            result[i] = result[i] * right # from last element, multiply the left and the right
            right *= nums[i] # update right
        return result
    
```
