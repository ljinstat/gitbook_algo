# 78. Subsets \(medium\) DFS

## Question:

Given a set of **distinct** integers, _nums_, return all possible subsets \(the power set\).

**Note:** The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

## Thought:

* [Backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking) is an algorithm for finding all solutions by exploring all potential candidates. If the solution candidate turns to be _not_ a solution \(or at least not the _last_ one\), backtracking algorithm discards it by making some changes on the previous step, _i.e.backtracks_ and then try again.
*   We define a backtrack function named `backtrack(first, curr)`which takes the index of first element to add and a current combination as arguments.

  * If the current combination is done, we add the combination to the final output.
  * Otherwise, we iterate over the indexes `i` from `first` to the length of the entire sequence `n`.
    * Add integer `nums[i]` into the current combination `curr`.
    * Proceed to add more integers into the combination :`backtrack(i + 1, curr)`.
    * Backtrack by removing `nums[i]` from `curr`.

* DFS

## Solution:

class Solution:
    def subsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        if not nums:
            return 
        results = []
        self.backtrack(results, nums, start=0, path=[])
        return results

    def backtrack(self, results, nums, start, path):
        results.append(path)
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            self.backtrack(results, nums, i+1, path+[nums[i]])
```
