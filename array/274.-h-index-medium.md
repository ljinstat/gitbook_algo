# 274. H-Index \(medium\)

## Question:

Given an array of citations \(each citation is a non-negative integer\) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index h if h of his/her Npapers have **at least** h citations each, and the other N âˆ’ h papers have **no more than** h citations each."

**Example:**

```text
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3 
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
             received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
             two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
```

**Note:** If there are several possible values for _h_, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

## Thoughts:

* bucket sort \(counting sort\) ?

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def hIndex(self, citations):
        """
        :type citations: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        # bucket sort
        n = len(citations)
        s = 0
        bucket = [0] * (n + 1)
        for c in range(n):
            if citations[c] >= n:
                bucket[n] += 1
            else:
                bucket[citations[c]] += 1 # add 1 to the index which is the citation 
        for i in range(n, -1, -1):
            s += bucket[i]
            if s >= i:
                return i
        return 0
```
