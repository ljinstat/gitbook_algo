# 244. Shortest Word Distance II \(medium\)

## Question:

This is a follow up of [Shortest Word Distance](javascript:void%28%29). The only difference is now you are given the list of words and your method will be called repeatedly many times with different parameters. How would you optimize it?

Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words word1 and word2 and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

For example,  
Assume that words = `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

Given word1 = `“coding”`, word2 = `“practice”`, return 3.  
Given word1 = `"makes"`, word2 = `"coding"`, return 1.

Note:  
You may assume that word1 does not equal to word2, and word1 and word2 are both in the list.  


## Thoughts:

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def shortestDist2(self, word1, word2, words):
        worddict = {}
        for word in set(words):
            worddict[word] = []
        for i in range(len(words)):
            worddict[words[i]].append(i)
        i, j = 0, 0
        result = sys.maxsize
        while i < len(worddict[word1]) and j < len(worddict[word2]): # i, j are the index of index lists
            result = min(result, abs(worddict[word1][i] - worddict[word2][j]))
            if worddict[word1][i] < worddict[word2][j]: # only change the smallest index
                i += 1
            else:
                j += 1
        return result
```
