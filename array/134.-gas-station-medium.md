# 134. Gas Station \(medium\)

## Question:

There are _N_ gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at station _i_ is `gas[i]`.

You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from station _i_ to its next station \(_i_+1\). You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

**Note:**

* If there exists a solution, it is guaranteed to be unique.
* Both input arrays are non-empty and have the same length.
* Each element in the input arrays is a non-negative integer.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Explanation:
Start at station 3 (index 3) and fill up with 4 unit of gas. Your tank = 0 + 4 = 4
Travel to station 4. Your tank = 4 - 1 + 5 = 8
Travel to station 0. Your tank = 8 - 2 + 1 = 7
Travel to station 1. Your tank = 7 - 3 + 2 = 6
Travel to station 2. Your tank = 6 - 4 + 3 = 5
Travel to station 3. The cost is 5. Your gas is just enough to travel back to station 3.
Therefore, return 3 as the starting index.
```

## Thought:

* If total costs is superior than total gas, there will be a result.

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def canCompleteCircuit(self, gas, cost):
        """
        :type gas: List[int]
        :type cost: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not gas or not cost or sum(cost) > sum(gas):
            return -1
        tank = 0
        starter = 0
        for i in range(len(gas)):
            tank += gas[i] - cost[i]
            if tank < 0:
                starter = i + 1
                tank = 0
        return starter
            
```
