# 75. Sort Colors \(medium\)

## Question:

Given an array with _n_ objects colored red, white or blue, sort them [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) ****so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.

Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

**Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

## Thought:

* three pointers
* exchange 0 to the left, move 2 to the right and keep 1 still

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # three pointers 
        if not nums or len(nums) == 0:
            return 
        idx = 0
        zero = 0 # last zero
        two = len(nums) - 1 # first two
        while idx <= two: # <=
            if nums[idx] == 0:
                nums[idx], nums[zero] = nums[zero], nums[idx]
                idx += 1
                zero += 1
            elif nums[idx] == 1: # do nothing move forward
                idx += 1
            else:
                nums[idx], nums[two] = nums[two], nums[idx]
                two -= 1 # keep index still
        return nums
```
