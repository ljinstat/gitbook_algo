# 219. Contains Duplicate II

## Question:

Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that **nums\[i\] = nums\[j\]** and the **absolute** difference between i and j is at most k.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
```

## Thoughts:

* hash table

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def containsNearbyDuplicate(self, nums, k):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type k: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        hash_table = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums): # absolute diff is at most k
            if num in hash_table and i - hash_table[num] <= k: # judge whether element is in the dictionary
                return True
            else:
                hash_table[num] = i
        return False
```
