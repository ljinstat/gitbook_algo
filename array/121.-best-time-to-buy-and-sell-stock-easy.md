# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock \(easy\)

## Question:

Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction \(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock\), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

## Thought:

* iterating to find miminal price and maximal profit.

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # for each selling point, find smallest price before it
        if not prices or len(prices) < 2:
            return 0
        min_price = sys.maxsize
        max_profit = 0
        for p in prices:
            if p < min_price:
                min_price = p
            if p - min_price > max_profit:
                max_profit = p - min_price
        return max_profit
```
