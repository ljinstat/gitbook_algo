# 1. Two Sum \(easy\)

## Question:

Given an array of integers, return **indices** of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have _**exactly**_ one solution, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

## Thought:

* Hash table: key is the current number, value is the current index; if current number finds its comlimentary in the hash table, the output is \[dict\[comlimentary\], i \]
* sort + two pointers: left + right O\(nlogn\) + O\(n\)\(if return index\)

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    # one-pass hash table
        dic = {}
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            complement = target - nums[i]
            if complement in dic:
                return dic[complement], i
            else:
                dic[nums[i]] = i
        return -1, -1
    # sort + two pointers
        nums = sorted(nums)
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            if nums[left] + nums
```
