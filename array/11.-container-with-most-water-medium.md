# 11. Container With Most Water \(medium\)

## Question:

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate \(i, ai\). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at \(i, ai\) and \(i, 0\). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

## Thought:

* two pointers left and right
* keep the longer height

## Solution:

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return 0
        max_water = - sys.maxsize
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while left < right:
            curr = min(nums[left], nums[right]) * (right - left)
            if curr > max_water:
                max_water = curr
            if nums[left] > nums[right]:
                right -= 1
            else:
                left += 1
        return max_water
```
