# 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II \(easy\)

## Question:

Say you have an array for which the _i_th element is the price of a given stock on day _i_.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like \(i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times\).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time \(i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again\).

## Thought:

* [https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/discuss/208241/Explanation-for-the-dummy-like-me.](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-ii/discuss/208241/Explanation-for-the-dummy-like-me.)
* We should choose `j` that `prices[j]` is as **big** as possible, and choose `i` that `prices[i]` is as **small** as possible \(of course in their local range\).

  Let's say, we have a range `[3, 2, 5]`, we will choose `(2,5)` instead of `(3,5)`, because `2<3`.  
  Now, if we add `8` into this range: `[3, 2, 5, 8]`, we will choose `(2, 8)` instead of `(2,5)` because `8>5`.

  From this observation, from day `X`, the buying day will be the last **continuous** day that the price is smallest. Then, the selling day will be the last **continuous** day that the price is biggest.

## Solution:

class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if not prices or len(prices) < 2:
            return 0
        buy = 0
        sell = 0
        profit = 0
        i = 0
        n = len(prices) - 1
        while i < n:
            while i < n and prices[i] >= prices[i+1]:
                i += 1 # continuous smallest value
            buy = prices[i]
            while i < n and prices[i] <= prices[i+1]:
                i += 1
            sell = prices[i]
            profit += sell - buy
        return profit
```
