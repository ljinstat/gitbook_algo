# 598. Zombie in Matrix \(medium\) BFS

## Question:

Given a 2D grid, each cell is either a wall 2, a zombie 1 or people 0 \(the number zero, one, two\).Zombies can turn the nearest people\(up/down/left/right\) into zombies every day, but can not through wall. How long will it take to turn all people into zombies? Return -1 if can not turn all people into zombies.

**Example**  
Given a matrix:  
  
0 1 2 0 0  
1 0 0 2 1  
0 1 0 0 0  
return 2

## Thought:

* BFS: level order, each time we add new zombies into the queue
