# 946. Validate Stack Sequences （medium）

## Question:

Given two sequences `pushed` and `popped` **with distinct values**, return `true` if and only if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
```

## Thought:

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def validateStackSequences(self, pushed, popped):
        """
        :type pushed: List[int]
        :type popped: List[int]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # greedy
        stack = []
        idx = 0
        for num in pushed:
            stack.append(num)
            while stack and stack[-1] == popped[idx]:
                stack.pop()
                idx += 1
        return not stack
```
