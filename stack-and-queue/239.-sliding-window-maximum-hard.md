# 239. Sliding Window Maximum \(hard\)

## Question:

Given an array _nums_, there is a sliding window of size _k_ which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the _k_ numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        # dequeue
        if not nums or k <= 0:
            return []
        dq = collections.deque()
        result = []
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            # assure that the rightmost value is larger than the current one
            while dq and nums[dq[-1]] < num:
                dq.pop() # pop the rightmost one
            dq.append(i)
            # check the leftmost value in boundary
            if dq[0] == i - k:
                dq.popleft()
            # add maximum to result if dq is full
            if i + 1 >= k:
                result.append(nums[dq[0]])
        return result
