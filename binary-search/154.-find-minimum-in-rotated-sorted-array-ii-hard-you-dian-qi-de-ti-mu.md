# 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II \(hard\)  有点奇葩的题目

## Question:

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

\(i.e.,  `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become  `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`\).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

**Note:**

* This is a follow up problem to [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/).
* Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?

## Thought:

* This code is correct to return the minimum value of the array. But in terms of "find the minimum value index" it is not right.  
  Consider this case: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1  
  the min index returned is 0, while actually it should be 9.  
  For this case: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2  
  it will return the correct index, which is 8.

  The reason is, the pivot index will be passed by at hi--. To avoid this, we can add the following judgement:

  else {

  ```text
  https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/discuss/48808/My-pretty-simple-code-to-solve-it
  if (nums[hi - 1] > nums[hi]) {
      lo = hi;
      break;
  }
  hi--;
  ```

  }

* Time complexity: the worst case is O\(N\)

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def findMin(self, nums):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :rtype: int
        """
        if not nums:
            return
        if len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) / 2
            if nums[mid] < nums[right]:
                right = mid
            elif nums[mid] > nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else: # if equal
                if nums[right - 1] > nums[right]:
                    left = right
                    break
                right -= 1
        return nums[left]      
```
