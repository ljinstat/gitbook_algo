# 278. First Bad Version \(easy\)

## Question:

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

## Thought:

* two ways: start = mid + check or start = mid + 1 plus return start
* It is more certain to use check start or end

## Solution:

```text
# The isBadVersion API is already defined for you.
# @param version, an integer
# @return a bool
# def isBadVersion(version):

class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        if n <= 0:
            return 0
        start = 1
        end = n
        while start + 1 < end:
            mid = start + (end - start) // 2
            call = isBadVersion(mid)
            if call:
                end = mid
            else:
                start = mid + 1 # or start = mid
        return start
        # if isBadVersion(start):
        #     return start
        # elif isBadVersion(end):
        #     return end
        # else:
        #     return -1
```
