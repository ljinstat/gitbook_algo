# 69. Sqrt\(x\) \(easy\)

## Question:

Implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of _x_, where _x_ is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

## Thought:

* binary search
* newton's method

## Solution:

```text
def mySqrt(self, x):
    l, r = 0, x
    while l <= r:
        mid = l + (r-l)//2
        if mid * mid <= x < (mid+1)*(mid+1):
            return mid
        elif x < mid * mid:
            r = mid
        else:
            l = mid + 1
    #--------Newton----------------------
    r = x
    while r * r > x:
        r = (r + x/r) // 2 # xn = (xn + x/xn)/2
    return int(r)
    
```
