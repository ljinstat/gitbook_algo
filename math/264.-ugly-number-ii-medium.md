# 264. Ugly Number II \(medium\)

## Question:

Write a program to find the `n`-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are **positive numbers** whose prime factors only include `2, 3, 5`. 

**Example:**

```text
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

**Note:**  

1. `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.
2. `n` **does not exceed 1690**.

## Thought:

* Regarding them as three sequences, then merge them into the same array

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def nthUglyNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        if not n or n <= 0:
            return 0
        result = [1] * n
        result[0] = 1
        # regard it as three sequences, x * 2, y * 3, z * 5
        # then merge three sequences
        i2, i3, i5 = 0, 0, 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            result[i] = min(result[i2]*2, result[i3]*3, result[i5]*5)
            if result[i] == result[i2]*2:
                i2 += 1
            if result[i] == result[i3]*3:
                i3 += 1
            if result[i] == result[i5]*5:
                i5 += 1
        return result[-1]
```
