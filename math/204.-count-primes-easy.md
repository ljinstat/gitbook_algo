# 204. Count Primes \(easy\)

## Question:

Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number, **n**.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 prime numbers less than 10, they are 2, 3, 5, 7.
```

## Thought:

* The [Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) is one of the most efficient ways to find all prime numbers up to n
* We start off with a table of n numbers. Let's look at the first number, 2. We know all multiples of 2 must not be primes, so we mark them off as non-primes. Then we look at the next number, 3. Similarly, all multiples of 3 such as 3 Ã— 2 = 6, 3 Ã— 3 = 9, ... must not be primes, so we mark them off as well. Now we look at the next number, 4, which was already marked off.

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def countPrimes(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n < 2: # primes are from 2
            return 0
        primes = [1] * n
        primes[0] = 0
        primes[1] = 0
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5)+1):
            if primes[i] != 0:
                primes[i*i:n:i] = [0] * ((n-1-i*i)//i + 1)
        return sum(primes)
```
