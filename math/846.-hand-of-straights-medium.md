# 846. Hand of Straights \(medium\)

## Question:

Alice has a `hand` of cards, given as an array of integers.

Now she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is size `W`, and consists of `W` consecutive cards.

Return `true` if and only if she can.

1. 
**Example 1:**

```text
Input: hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], W = 3
Output: true
Explanation: Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8].
```

## Thought:

* Number of values in the array must fullfill x groups of w values.
* Use a hash table to save the counts of each value
* Select a minimum in the rest of values to start a new group using a min heap

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], W: int) -> bool:
        length = len(hand)
        if length % W:
            return False
        if not hand:
            return False
        if W == 1: # have only one card in a group
            return True
        
        # count dictionary
        count = {}
        for c in hand:
            if c not in count:
                count[c] = 1
            else:
                count[c] += 1
        heapq.heapify(hand) # heapsort
        # at each time we should pop the minimal value
        for _ in range(length // W):
            start = heapq.heappop(hand)
            while count[start] == 0:
                start = heapq.heappop(hand)
            for _ in range(W):
                if start in count: 
                    count[start] -= 1
                else:
                    return False
                if count[start] < 0:
                    return False # it does not exist anymore this number
                start += 1
        return True
```
