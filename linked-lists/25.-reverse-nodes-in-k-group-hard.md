# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group \(hard\)

## Question:

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.

_k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

**Example:**

Given this linked list: `1->2->3->4->5`

For _k_ = 2, you should return: `2->1->4->3->5`

For _k_ = 3, you should return: `3->2->1->4->5`

## Thought:

* dummy node
* find kth node then reverse it
* iterative
* recursion

## Solution:

```text
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        # D -> n1 ->... -> nk -> nk+1
        prev = dummy
        while prev:
            prev = self.reverseKNodes(prev, k)
        return dummy.next
    
    def reverseKNodes(self, head, k):
        # head -> n1 ->... -> nk -> nk+1
        # head -> nk ->... -> n1 -> nk+1
        # find the kth node
        curr = head
        n1 = head.next
        for _ in range(k):
            curr = curr.next
            if not curr:
                return 
        nk = curr
        nk1 = curr.next
        # reverse
        prev = head
        curr = head.next
        while curr != nk1:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        # nk -> ... -> n1 <-> head
        head.next = nk
        n1.next = nk1
        return n1
```

```text
class Solution:
    def reverseKGroup(self, head, k):
        count = 0
        curr = head
        while curr and count < k:
            curr = curr.next
            count += 1
        if count < k: 
            return head
        if count == k:    
            new_head, prev = self.reverse(head, k)
        head.next = self.reverseKGroup(new_head, k)
        return prev
    
    def reverse(self, head, count):
        prev = None
        curr = head
        while count > 0:
            temp = curr.next
