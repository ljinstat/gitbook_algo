# 234. Palindrome Linked List \(easy\)

## Question:

Given a singly linked list, determine if it is a palindrome.

```text
Input: 1->2->2->1
Output: true
```

## Thought:

* find middle point \(slow and fast points\)
* reverse the second part \(reverse\)
* compare two parts

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return True
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        prev = None
        curr = slow
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = temp
        while prev:
            if prev.val != head.val:
                return False
            prev = prev.next
            head = head.next
        return True
```
