# 206. Reverse Linked List \(easy\)

## Question:

Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Thought:

* recursion and iteration [https://blog.csdn.net/FX677588/article/details/72357389](https://blog.csdn.net/FX677588/article/details/72357389)

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        # recursion
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        newhead = self.reverseList(head.next) # recurse til the end
        head.next.next = head # reverse the direction 
        head.next = None # cut the previous direction
        return newhead
    # ------------------------------------------
    # iteration
        prev = None
        curr = head
        while curr:
            next_temp = head.next
            head.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_temp
        return prev # new head
```
