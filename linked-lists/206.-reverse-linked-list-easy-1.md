# 206. Reverse Linked List \(easy\)

## Question:

Reverse a singly linked list.

**Example:**

```text
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
```

**Follow up:**

A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

## Thought:

* iteration, recursion

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # iterative
        prev = None
        curr = head
        while curr:
            next_temp = curr.next
            curr.next = prev
            prev = curr
            curr = next_temp
        return prev
        # -------------------------------------
        # recursion
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        curr = self.reverseList(head.next)
        head.next.next = curr
        head.next = None
        return curr
```
