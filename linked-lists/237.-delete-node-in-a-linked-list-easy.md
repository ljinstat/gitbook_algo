# 237. Delete Node in a Linked List \(easy\)

## Question:

Write a function to delete a node \(except the tail\) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.

Given linked list -- head = \[4,5,1,9\], which looks like following:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/28/237_example.png)

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: head = [4,5,1,9], node = 5
Output: [4,1,9]
Explanation: You are given the second node with value 5, the linked list should become 4 -> 1 -> 9 after calling your function.
```

## Thought:

* node.next = node.next.next -&gt;&gt; delete this node
* 1-&gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4 delete 3
* 1. 1-&gt;2-&gt;4-&gt;4 先赋值当前的node它下一个node的值
  2. 1-&gt;2-&gt;4 当前node指向下一个node的next

## Solution:

```text
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def deleteNode(self, node):
        """
        :type node: ListNode
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify node in-place instead.
        """
        node.val = node.next.val
        node.next = node.next.next
```
