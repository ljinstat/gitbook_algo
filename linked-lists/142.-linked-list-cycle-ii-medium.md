# 142. Linked List Cycle II \(medium\)

## Question:

Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Note:** Do not modify the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

## Thought:

* two pointers

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def detectCycle(self, head):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not head:
            return None
        slow = fast = head
        while fast and fast.next: # pay attention to make sure fast exists
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                break
        else:
            return None
        while head != slow:
            slow = slow.next
            head = head.next
        return head
```
