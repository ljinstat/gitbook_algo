# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List （medium）

## Question:

Given a linked list, remove the _n_-th node from the end of list and return its head.

**Example:**

```text
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.

After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Note:**

Given _n_ will always be valid.

**Follow up:**

Could you do this in one pass?

## Thought:

* two pointers

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head, n):
        """
        :type head: ListNode
        :type n: int
        :rtype: ListNode
        """
        if not head or n == 0:
            return None
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        dummy.next = head
        prev = dummy
        curr = dummy
        for _ in range(n):
            if prev.next:
                prev = prev.next # if length of the list is smaller than k
            else:
                return None
        while prev and prev.next:
            curr = curr.next
            prev = prev.next
        curr.next = curr.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
