# 141. Linked List Cycle \(easy\)

## Question:

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position \(0-indexed\) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
```

## Thought:

* two pointers: faster and slower pointers
* Now consider a cyclic list and imagine the slow and fast pointers are two runners racing around a circle track. The fast runner will eventually meet the slow runner. Why? Consider this case \(we name it case A\) - The fast runner is just one step behind the slow runner. In the next iteration, they both increment one and two steps respectively and meet each other.

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False
        slow = head
        fast = head.next # necessary
        while slow != fast:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return True
```
