# 328. Odd Even Linked List \(medium\)

## Question:

Given a singly linked list, group all odd nodes together followed by the even nodes. Please note here we are talking about the node number and not the value in the nodes.

You should try to do it in place. The program should run in O\(1\) space complexity and O\(nodes\) time complexity.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 1->3->5->2->4->NULL
```

## Thought:

* two pointers and two heads
* odd and even
* head and even head
* odd = head, even = head.next
* at last, odd.next = even\_head, return head

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        if not head:
            return head
        odd = head
        even = head.next
        even_head = even
        while even and even.next:
            odd.next = even.next
            odd = odd.next
            even.next = odd.next
            even = even.next
        odd.next = even_head
        return head
```
