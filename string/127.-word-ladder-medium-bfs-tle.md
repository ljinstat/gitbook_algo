# 127. Word Ladder \(medium\) BFS/Bi-BFS \(TLE\) ???

## Question:



Given two words \(_beginWord_ and _endWord_\), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that _beginWord_ is _not_ a transformed word.

**Note:**

* Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: 5

Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
return its length 5.

```

## Thought:

* BFS

## Solution:

Time limit exceeded 

```text
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList or not wordList or len(wordList) == 0:
            return 0
        # BFS
        dq = collections.deque([beginWord]) # must add []
        visited = set([beginWord])
        path = 0
        
        while dq:
            size = len(dq)
            path += 1
            for _ in range(size):
                curr_word = dq.popleft()
                if curr_word == endWord:
                    return path
                for w in self.nextWord(curr_word, wordList):
                    if w not in wordList or w in visited:
                        continue
                    visited.add(w)
                    dq.append(w)
        return 0
                    
    def nextWord(self, word, wordList):
        word_list = []
        letter_set = set([l for w in wordList for l in w ]) # only consider possible letters
        for i in range(len(word)):
            left, right = word[:i], word[i+1:]
            for char in letter_set:
                if word[i] == char:
                    continue
                word_list.append(left + char + right)
        return word_list

```
