# 202. Happy Number \(easy\)

## Question:

Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 \(where it will stay\), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

**Example:** 

```text
Input: 19
Output: true
Explanation: 
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

## Thought:

* if it is not a happy number, the sum will appear repeatedly 
* Floyd cycle detection

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if not n:
            return False
        dict = set()
        while n != 1:
            n = sum([int(i)**2 for i in str(n)])
            if n in dict:
                return False
            else:
                dict.add(n)
        return True
```

```text
int digitSquareSum(int n) {
    int sum = 0, tmp;
    while (n) {
        tmp = n % 10;
        sum += tmp * tmp;
        n /= 10;
    }
    return sum;
}

bool isHappy(int n) {
    int slow, fast;
    slow = fast = n;
    do {
        slow = digitSquareSum(slow);
        fast = digitSquareSum(fast);
        fast = digitSquareSum(fast);
    } while(slow != fast);
    if (slow == 1) return 1;
    else return 0;
}
```
