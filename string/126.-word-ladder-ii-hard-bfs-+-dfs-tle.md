# 126. Word Ladder II \(hard\) BFS + DFS \(TLE\)

## Question:

Given two words \(_beginWord_ and _endWord_\), and a dictionary's word list, find all shortest transformation sequence\(s\) from _beginWord_ to _endWord_, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that _beginWord_ is _not_ a transformed word.

**Note:**

* Return an empty list if there is no such transformation sequence.
* All words have the same length.
* All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
* You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
* You may assume _beginWord_ and _endWord_ are non-empty and are not the same.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
beginWord = "hit",
endWord = "cog",
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]
```

## Thought:

* BFS: calculate all distances from the end to the start
* DFS: find all shortest path in the graph

## Solution:

Time limit exceeded
