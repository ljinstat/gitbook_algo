# 1.3 URLify

## Question:

Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20 You may assume that the string has suf cient space at the end to hold the additional characters,and that you are given the "true" length of the string. \(Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.\)

EXAMPLE

Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13Output: "Mr%20John%20Smith"

## Thought:

* from right to left, the length is the original length of string, str is enough for copy and modificaiton.
* two pointers: new\_len and orig\_len, copy original chars to new one.

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def Urlify(self, str, length):
        if not str or length <= 0:
            return str
        # new_len = len(str)
        space = 0
        for s in str:
            if s == ' ':
                space += 1
        new_len = length + 2 * space - 1 # index
        orig_len = length - 1
        while new_len > 0 and orig_len > 0:
            if s[orig_len] == ' ':
                s[new_len-2:new_len+1] = '%20'
                new_len -= 3
            else:
                s[new_len] = s[orig_len]
                new_len -= 1
            orig_len -= 1 # move ahead one step for both conditions
        return s
```
