# 1.4 Palindrome Permutation \(266 locked\)

## Question:

Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palinÂ­ drome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same rwards and backwards. A permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

EXAMPLE

Input: Tact Coa  
Output: True \(permutations: "taco cat", "atco eta", etc.\)

## Thought:

* if length of string is odd, then the count % 2 must be 1; if length of string is even, then the count % 2 must be 0
* hashmap
* array O\(n\) O\(1\)

## Solution:

```text
class Solution(object):
    def palindromePermutation(self, str):
        if not str or len(str) <= 1:
            return False
        map = [0] * 128
        for s in str:
            map[ord(s)] += 1
        count = 0
        for num in map:
            count += num % 2
        return count <= 1
```
