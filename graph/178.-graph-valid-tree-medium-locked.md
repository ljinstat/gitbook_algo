# 178. Graph Valid Tree \(medium\) \(locked\) BFS

## Question:

Given `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and a list of `undirected`edges \(each edge is a pair of nodes\), write a function to check whether these edges make up a valid tree.

#### Example

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: true.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: n = 5 edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
Output: false.
```

#### Notice

You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are `undirected`, `[0, 1]` is the same as `[1, 0]` and thus will not appear together in edges.

## Thought:

* BFS: traverse the graph layer by layer
* HashMap: 邻接表 to represent the graph
* two conditions: 1. the graph does not have any cycle, n nodes with exactly n - 1 edges; 2. all nodes are connected, we can visit all nodes from the root
* add input and output together into the dictionary because in BFS we may visit the output in the dictionary.
* Another solution: Union Find

## Solution:

```text
def validTree(self, n, edges):
    # write your code here
    # if not n or not edges or len(edges) == 0:
    #     return False
    # first condition: n nodes and n - 1 edges
    if len(edges) != n - 1:
        return False
    if n == 1 and not edges:
        return True # 1, []
    # second condition: nodes are all connected, it means that all nodes can be traversed from the root
    nodes_dict = {}
    for i, o in edges:
        if i not in nodes_dict:
            nodes_dict[i] = [o]
        else:
            nodes_dict[i].append(o)
        if o not in nodes_dict:
            nodes_dict[o] = [i]
        else:
            nodes_dict[o].append(i)
            
    visited = set()
    visited.add(0)
    
    dq = collections.deque()
    dq.append(0)
    # bfs traverse layers 
    while dq:
        curr = dq.popleft()
        #visited.add(curr)
        for node in nodes_dict[curr]:
            if node not in visited:
                visited.add(node)
                dq.append(node)
    return len(visited) == n
```
