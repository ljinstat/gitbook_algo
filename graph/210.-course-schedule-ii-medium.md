# 210. Course Schedule II \(medium\)

## Question:

There are a total of _n_ courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`

Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
             course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
```

## Thought:

* BFS and DFS
* topological sorting

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    def findOrder(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        graph = {x: [] for x in range(numCourses)}
        degree = [0 for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for num in prerequisites:
            i, j = num
            graph[j].append(i)
            degree[i] += 1
        
        order = []
        start = [num for num in range(numCourses) if degree[num] == 0]
        dq = collections.deque(start)
        
        while dq:
            curr = dq.popleft()
            order.append(curr) # attention here
            for nb in graph[curr]:
                degree[nb] -= 1
                if degree[nb] == 0:
                    dq.append(nb)
        return order if len(order) == numCourses else []
                    
```
