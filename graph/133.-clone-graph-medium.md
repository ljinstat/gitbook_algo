# 133. Clone Graph \(medium\)

## Question:

Given a reference of a node in a [**connected**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectivity_%28graph_theory%29#Connected_graph) undirected graph, return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) \(clone\) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a val \(`int`\) and a list \(`List[Node]`\) of its neighbors.

## Thought:

* find all nodes and put them into a set \(BFS traverse all neighbors: dq + set\)
* map old nodes to new nodes, only copy val
* map new neighbors to new nodes

## Solution:

```text
"""
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, neighbors):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors
"""
class Solution:
    def cloneGraph(self, node: 'Node') -> 'Node':
        # edge cases
        if not node:
            return node
        root = node
        # find all nodes
        nodes = self.getNodes(node)
        # copy nodes, map old nodes to new nodes, only copy val
        nodes_dict = {}
        for node in nodes:
            nodes_dict[node] = Node(node.val, [])
        # copy neighbors nodes
        for node in nodes:
            node_copy = nodes_dict[node] # error use n here but node below
            if node.neighbors:
                for nb in node.neighbors:
                    n_copy = nodes_dict[nb] # new neighbors of old neighbor, neighbor is a node      
                    node_copy.neighbors.append(n_copy)
        return nodes_dict[root]
        
        
    def getNodes(self, node):
        nodes_set = set() # error here, node must be included
        nodes_set.add(node)
        dq = collections.deque()
        dq.append(node)
        while dq:
            curr = dq.popleft()
            for n in curr.neighbors:
                if n not in nodes_set:
                    nodes_set.add(n)
                    dq.append(n)
        return nodes_set
        
```
