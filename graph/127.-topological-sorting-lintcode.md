# 127. Topological Sorting \(lintcode\)

## Question:

Given an **directed graph**, a topological order of the graph nodes is defined as follow:

* For each directed edge `A -> B` in graph, A must before B in the order list.
* The first node in the order can be any node in the graph with no nodes direct to it.

Find any topological order for the given graph.

## Thought:

* BFS: only 0 indegree node can be push to the queue
* How to find out the hirarchy of the graph? By using indegree. The value of indegree is the number of tasks before this node.
* Everytime we can traverse to one node, it means that we solve one task before it, so the value of indegree is reduced by one.

## Solution:

```text
class Solution:
    """
    @param: graph: A list of Directed graph node
    @return: Any topological order for the given graph.
    """
    def topSort(self, graph):
        # write your code here
        #BFS
        # begin from nodes with 0 in-degree
        if not graph:
            return 
        
        d_dict = self.indegree(graph)
        first_nodes = [node for node in graph if d_dict[node] == 0]
        dq = collections.deque(first_nodes)
        result = []
        while dq:
            curr = dq.popleft()
            result.append(curr) 
            for neighbor in curr.neighbors:
                if d_dict[neighbor] >= 1:
                    d_dict[neighbor] -= 1
                if d_dict[neighbor] == 0:
                    dq.append(neighbor) # only push nodes wiht 0 in-degree to the deque
        return result
        
        
    def indegree(self, graph):
        if not graph:
            return
        d_dict = {x:0 for x in graph}
        for node in graph:
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                d_dict[neighbor] += 1
        return d_dict
```
